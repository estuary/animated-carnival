-- TODO(johnny): Here's the plan for open graph:
-- For any given connector, we need to identify a suitable URL which is typically
-- just it's website, like https://postgresql.org or https://hubspot.com.
-- We can fetch Open Graph responses from these URL as an administrative scripted task.
-- We can shell out for this, and this tool seems to do a pretty good job of it:
--   go install github.com/johnreutersward/opengraph/cmd/opengraph@latest
--
-- Example:
-- ~/go/bin/opengraph -json https://postgresql.org | jq 'map( { (.Property|tostring): .Content } ) | add'
-- {
--   "url": "https://www.postgresql.org/",
--   "type": "article",
--   "image": "https://www.postgresql.org/media/img/about/press/elephant.png",
--   "title": "PostgreSQL",
--   "description": "The world's most advanced open source database.",
--   "site_name": "PostgreSQL"
-- }
--
-- We'll store these responses verbatim in `open_graph_raw`.
-- Payloads almost always include `title`, `image`, `description`, `url`, sometimes `site_name`,
-- and sometimes other things. Often the responses are directly suitable for inclusion
-- in user-facing UI components. A few sites don't support any scrapping at all
-- (a notable example is Google analytics), and others return fields which aren't quite
-- right or suited for direct display within our UI.
--
-- So, we'll need to tweak many of them, and we'll do this by maintaining minimal
-- patches of open-graph responses in the `open_graph_patch`. These can be dynamically
-- edited via Supabase as needed, as an administrative function, and are applied
-- via JSON merge patch to the raw responses, with the merged object stored in the
-- user-facing `open_graph` column. Keeping patches in the database allows non-technical
-- folks to use Supabase, Retool, or similar to edit this stuff without getting
-- an engineer involved.
--
-- We can, for example, specify '{"title":"A better title"}' within the connector patch,
-- which will update the `open_graph` response while leaving all other fields (say, the
-- `description` or `image`) as they are in the raw response. This is important because
-- it gives us an easy means to periodically update connector logos, text copy, etc.
